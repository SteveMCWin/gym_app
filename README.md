# Fitness Tracking App
My second golang project.
I track my own workouts in the notes app, which is a bit tedious, so I decided to make a web app that would solve the problems I encounter on an almost daily basis.

This poject is the continuation of learning backend web development, which started with the [2D Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/SteveMCWin/golang_tic_tac_toe) project, also created using golang and SQLite.

## Features
- User authentication
- Password change through email
- Workout plan creation/editing/deletion
- Workout plan tracking
- Basic workout plan analysis
- Viewing and copying other users workout plans
- Gym - workout plan compatability analysis
- Per-exercise progression over time
